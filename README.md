# Pulse Data Platform

## Local Spark on Windows

Java 17 must be installed and `JAVA_HOME` must point to it. The Spark entry
point automatically configures the remaining Windows compatibility settings
for its own process:

- `HADOOP_HOME` resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/hadoop`.
- `TEMP` and `TMP` resolve to `<project-root>/tmp/spark`.
- `<project-root>/tmp/hadoop/bin` is prepended to the process-local `PATH` so
  Hadoop can load `hadoop.dll`.
- Spark's Ivy dependency cache resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/spark/ivy`.
- Spark's local working directory resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/spark/local`.

Keep `winutils.exe` and `hadoop.dll` in `tmp/hadoop/bin/`. The entire `tmp/`
directory is Git-ignored, including these machine-local compatibility files
and all Spark runtime output.

No user or system environment variables are changed. Existing process-level
values are respected, so a developer can still override them for one shell.

From the project root, run:

```powershell
python -m src.streaming.spark_streaming
```

## Bronze marketplace events

The Spark entry point persists Kafka records as append-only Parquet files in
two independently checkpointed streams:

```text
data/bronze/marketplace_events/
|-- valid/
|   `-- ingestion_date=YYYY-MM-DD/
`-- invalid/
    `-- ingestion_date=YYYY-MM-DD/

data/checkpoints/bronze/marketplace_events/
|-- valid/
`-- invalid/
```

Each record retains the parsed marketplace fields, Kafka key/topic/partition/
offset/timestamp, the original `raw_json`, `validation_errors`, and a Spark-
generated UTC ingestion timestamp. `ingestion_date` is derived from that UTC
timestamp and is used as a low-cardinality partition for practical local file
layout. Invalid messages retain any fields Spark could recover and are never
silently discarded.

The four output and checkpoint locations are configured in `.env.example`.
Relative values are resolved from the project root; absolute overrides are
also supported. Generated Bronze data and checkpoints remain covered by the
existing `data/*` Git ignore rule.

Spark checkpoints record source progress and file-sink commits, preventing
normal restarts of the same query from reprocessing committed offsets. This is
not a general exactly-once guarantee for arbitrary external side effects,
manual checkpoint deletion, or output/checkpoint path changes.

## Silver marketplace events

Run the bounded, test-friendly Silver stream from the project root with:

```powershell
python -m src.streaming.silver_streaming
```

The job reads only Bronze valid Parquet and writes two independently
checkpointed streams:

```text
data/silver/marketplace_events/
|-- valid/
|   `-- event_date=YYYY-MM-DD/
`-- rejected/
    `-- event_date=YYYY-MM-DD/

data/checkpoints/silver/marketplace_events/
|-- valid/
`-- rejected/
```

Silver trims identifiers, lowercases event types, uppercases country and
currency codes, preserves typed timestamps/numbers, and derives `event_date`
in UTC. Valid output retains Kafka and ingestion lineage but omits Bronze
`raw_json` and validation errors. Rejected rows retain `raw_json` and add
`silver_validation_errors` for diagnosis.

Quality rules reject missing core identifiers or timestamps, unsupported event
types, non-positive quantities, negative prices, non-two-letter country codes,
and non-three-letter currency codes. Records are quarantined rather than
silently dropped.

Quality-valid records use a seven-day event-time watermark by default and
`dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` on `event_id`. This removes repeated event IDs
while bounding streaming state; a duplicate arriving after the watermark
horizon is not guaranteed to be recognized. `event_date` is used for storage
partitioning because it supports common time-range queries without creating
the tiny partitions that high-cardinality customer or event IDs would cause.

Paths and the watermark are configurable through `.env.example`. Checkpoints
track each sink independently; changing or deleting them changes replay
behavior and may produce duplicate Parquet rows. The local job defaults to
four shuffle partitions to avoid excessive state-store files for this
development-scale dataset.

## Gold marketplace analytics

Build all Gold tables from the current Silver valid snapshot with:

```powershell
python -m src.analytics.gold_build
```

The batch build reads only `data/silver/marketplace_events/valid` and replaces
four query-ready Parquet datasets:

- `daily_sales`: successful payments grouped by UTC event date, country, and
  currency. Distinct paid order IDs define completed orders; revenue is the
  sum of `quantity * unit_price`, and average order value divides gross revenue
  by distinct completed orders.
- `customer_metrics`: lifetime event counts, first/last activity, paid units,
  gross paid revenue, and distinct paid orders per customer.
- `product_metrics`: product activity, paid units/revenue, and distinct
  customers. `seller_id` is retained only when the observed product-to-seller
  mapping is unambiguous.
- `funnel_metrics`: daily country-level event counts and adjacent-stage
  conversion ratios. A zero denominator produces null rather than division by
  zero.

Refunds are counted separately and do not reduce gross revenue in this first
version. Gold validates non-negative sales measures and conversion rates in
the range `[0, 1]` before writing.

`daily_sales` and `funnel_metrics` are partitioned by `event_date` for common
date-range filtering. Customer and product tables are not partitioned by their
high-cardinality identifiers. Output paths are configurable in `.env.example`
and generated data remains ignored by Git.

This phase performs a full overwrite from a consistent Silver snapshot. The
table builders and writers are separate so a future orchestrator can replace
the full refresh with partition-scoped incremental builds. Currency values are
not converted, refunds are not netted from revenue, and funnel rates are based
on event counts rather than cohort/session attribution.

## PostgreSQL analytics warehouse

PostgreSQL 16.4 is the local serving/query layer for the Gold snapshot. It is
deliberately separate from Airflow's PostgreSQL instance:

- `airflow-postgres` stores Airflow metadata only and is not host-published.
- `warehouse-postgres` (container `pulse-warehouse-postgres`) stores the
  `analytics` serving schema and is published at `localhost:5433`.

Host-side commands use `localhost:5433`. Docker services use
`warehouse-postgres:5432`. Both connect to database `pulse_analytics` as user
`pulse` by default. These are local-development credentials from
`.env.example`; override them in the untracked `.env` file outside local use.

Start the warehouse and load or validate it manually from the host with:

```powershell
docker compose up -d warehouse-postgres
python -m src.warehouse.load_gold load
python -m src.warehouse.load_gold validate
```

The loader creates four explicitly typed relational tables:

- `analytics.daily_sales`, indexed by `event_date`
- `analytics.customer_metrics`, indexed by `customer_id`
- `analytics.product_metrics`, indexed by `product_id`
- `analytics.funnel_metrics`, indexed by `event_date`

Each run reads all four Gold Parquet datasets into staging tables, checks their
required columns and aggregate constraints, and publishes all four replacements
in one PostgreSQL transaction. A failure rolls back the whole refresh, leaving
the previous serving snapshot available. This is a rerunnable full refresh,
not incremental loading or CDC.

Connect with any PostgreSQL client (for example,
`psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U pulse -d pulse_analytics`) and query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM analytics.daily_sales ORDER BY event_date LIMIT 10;

SELECT customer_id, total_revenue
FROM analytics.customer_metrics
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT product_id, gross_revenue
FROM analytics.product_metrics
ORDER BY gross_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Airflow orchestration

Apache Airflow 2.11.2 runs entirely in Docker; no native Windows Airflow
installation is required. The local topology uses a webserver, scheduler with
`LocalExecutor`, one-shot initialization service, and PostgreSQL metadata
database. Celery and Redis are intentionally omitted for this single-machine
development deployment.

Bronze remains a continuously operating upstream Spark/Kafka service and is
not started or supervised by this DAG. The manually triggered
`pulse_analytics_pipeline` orchestrates only finite downstream work:

```text
check_bronze_available
  -> build_silver
  -> validate_silver
  -> build_gold
  -> validate_gold
  -> load_gold_to_warehouse
  -> validate_warehouse
```

`build_silver` uses the explicit `--orchestrated-snapshot` mode. It reads the
current Bronze valid dataset as a finite snapshot, reuses the existing Silver
normalization and quality classification, deterministically deduplicates by
`event_id`, and replaces Silver valid/rejected outputs. The existing default
available-now streaming mode and `--continuous` mode remain available for
standalone use. The orchestration snapshot intentionally does not reuse
host-created streaming checkpoints because checkpoint file URIs are not
portable between Windows and the Linux Airflow containers.

Copy the local defaults from `.env.example` into an untracked `.env` if you
want to override them, then initialize and start the services:

```powershell
docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and sign in with the local
development defaults `airflow` / `airflow`. Override
`AIRFLOW_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, database credentials, and
the webserver secret in `.env` when desired; these defaults are not suitable
for production.

Trigger the workflow in the UI or from the scheduler container:

```powershell
docker compose exec airflow-scheduler airflow dags trigger pulse_analytics_pipeline
```

The Airflow containers mount only `airflow/dags`, `src`, and `data`. Project-relative
host data is exposed as `/opt/pulse/data`; source is exposed read-only at
`/opt/pulse/src`. Airflow logs, Airflow metadata, and warehouse database files
use separate Docker named volumes; generated pipeline data and database dumps
remain covered by `.gitignore`.

This phase has no automatic schedule (`schedule=None`), permits only one active
DAG run, and gives each task one short retry. Silver orchestration is a full
snapshot rather than an incremental partition refresh, so it must not run
concurrently with the standalone Silver writer. Airflow does not yet manage
Bronze availability beyond validating its persisted Parquet input.
