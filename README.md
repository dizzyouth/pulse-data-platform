# Pulse Data Platform

## Local Spark on Windows

Java 17 must be installed and `JAVA_HOME` must point to it. The Spark entry
point automatically configures the remaining Windows compatibility settings
for its own process:

- `HADOOP_HOME` resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/hadoop`.
- `TEMP` and `TMP` resolve to `<project-root>/tmp/spark`.
- `<project-root>/tmp/hadoop/bin` is prepended to the process-local `PATH` so
  Hadoop can load `hadoop.dll`.
- Spark's Ivy dependency cache resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/spark/ivy`.
- Spark's local working directory resolves to `<project-root>/tmp/spark/local`.

Keep `winutils.exe` and `hadoop.dll` in `tmp/hadoop/bin/`. The entire `tmp/`
directory is Git-ignored, including these machine-local compatibility files
and all Spark runtime output.

No user or system environment variables are changed. Existing process-level
values are respected, so a developer can still override them for one shell.

From the project root, run:

```powershell
python -m src.streaming.spark_streaming
```
